Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Installed @vercel/analytics package (v1.6.1) using npm
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with the new dependency tree

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/app/layout.tsx**: Added Analytics component integration
  - Imported `Analytics` from '@vercel/analytics/next'
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
  - Preserved all existing code structure and components (PwaRegister, PwaInstallHint)

### 3. Verification Steps Completed
✓ Build completed successfully (78 static pages generated)
✓ Linter ran successfully (no new errors introduced)
✓ TypeScript compilation passed
✓ All existing functionality preserved

## Implementation Details:

This is an App Router project (Next.js 16.1.6), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `src/app/layout.tsx`. The component was placed at the end of the body tag, following best practices for analytics scripts to ensure they don't block page rendering.

The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when deployed to Vercel, with no additional configuration required.

## Files Modified:
- package.json (added @vercel/analytics dependency)
- package-lock.json (updated dependency lock file)
- src/app/layout.tsx (added Analytics component)
